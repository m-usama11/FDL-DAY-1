<p>Fiverr has released its second annual report detailing the urgent needs of marketing executives in the U.S. </p>
<p>A survey of more than 500 marketing leaders, completed in partnership with Censuswide, highlights the sector’s growing emphasis on adaptability and flexibility through the strategic deployment of freelancers to fill talent and skill gaps.</p>
<p>Key takeaways from the survey: nearly 70% of marketing executives reported an increase in freelancer use in 2024, particularly freelancers who are adept in new technology, like AI. And nearly 2 years since OpenAI made national headlines, marketing leaders still admit to having sort of ‘AI anxiety’; a majority feel negatively about AI. </p>
<p>For marketing executives, Q2 and Q3 are the most stressful and challenging quarters by far. </p>
<p>Over half of executives are open to leveraging freelancers to take over key administrative, procedural, and work-related tasks like brand management during these peak-stress periods. </p>
